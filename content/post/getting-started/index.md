## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio website. In this post you can find more about me and what I plan to do about in this portfolio website. 

## Get Started

👉 My name is Kemal.
💒 I am from Cyprus. 
📚 My background is in Economics which includes a Bachelors degree and two master degrees. During my Masters in the Netherlands I specialized more on urban, environmental and transport side of economics. I explored the dynamics of economic growth, urban development, housing affordability, living and working environments, mobility, resource depletion and climate change. Due to my interest in data analytics, I took extracurricular courses in Advanced Machine Learning and Data Science. 
💬 I started to my professional life in a commodity intelligence start up as a part-time Data Analyst in which later I moved to full time Market Intelligence Analyst.
🐦 My interests lies in combining my economics and business knowledge with solving real world problems with the help of data and analytics. I am open and passionate about pursuing my professional life in the direction where i can utilize advances in data analytics to answer complex business and real world problems where I can make a difference.

⏩ Moving forward, I will try to keep my blog post up to date about my endeavors. The posts will focus on both personal and professional passions of mine which are data analytics focused on variety of topics and more general easy going posts about food, travel and sports. 

Thank you for reading this. I hope it gives you an idea about me
