## Overview

- Welcome to my portfolio website! In this post, you can learn more about me and what I plan to showcase on this website.

## Get Started

- 💒 I am from Cyprus.

- 📚 My educational background is in Economics, including a Bachelor's degree and two Master's degrees. During my Master's program in the Netherlands, I specialized in the urban, environmental, and transport aspects of economics. I explored the dynamics of economic growth, urban development, housing affordability, living and working environments, mobility, resource depletion, and climate change. Due to my interest in data analytics, I also took extracurricular courses in Advanced Machine Learning and Data Science.

- 💬 I started my professional career as a part-time Data Analyst in a commodity intelligence start-up and later became a full-time Market Intelligence Analyst.

- 🐦 My interests lie in combining my economics and business knowledge with data analytics to solve real-world problems. I am passionate about pursuing a career where I can utilize data analytics to answer complex business and real-world problems and make a difference.

- ⏩ Moving forward, I will keep my blog up-to-date with my endeavors. The posts will focus on both personal and professional passions of mine, including data analytics on a variety of topics, as well as more general posts about food, travel, and sports.

- Thank you for reading. I hope this gives you a better idea of who I am.
